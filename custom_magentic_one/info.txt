1. main.py
Purpose: Entry point for running a demo task with a MagenticOne group chat system.

Key Functions:

Initializes a GPT-4o model client.

Creates a CustomFileSurfer agent.

Forms a team with MagenticOneGroupChat that includes the agent.

Runs a task ("What is the UV index in Melbourne today?") in a console UI.

2. custom_agent.py
Purpose: Defines a custom agent (CustomFileSurfer) that can preview and navigate local files.

Key Features:

Uses a file browser (MarkdownFileBrowser) to interact with files.

Processes user queries and responds using LLM tools for file navigation:

Open files.

Scroll through files.

Search within files.

Handles messages by maintaining chat history and interacting with files.

3. custom_orchaster.py
Purpose: Implements MagenticOneOrchestrator, a group chat orchestrator.

Key Functions:

Manages multi-agent coordination using a ledger system (tracks tasks, facts, and plans).

Ensures structured conversation flow and task completion.

Handles stalls, re-plans if needed, and generates a final answer.

Manages the life cycle of tasks and coordinates agent responses.

4. custom_chatgroup.py
Purpose: Defines MagenticOneGroupChat, which manages a group of agents via the orchestrator.

Key Features:

Wraps agents into a coordinated team managed by MagenticOneOrchestrator.

Handles setup of group chat parameters: participants, model client, max turns, stalls.

Supports component-based configuration and loading for reuse and scalability.

How It All Fits Together:
main.py uses CustomFileSurfer (from custom_agent.py) as an agent in a MagenticOneGroupChat (from custom_chatgroup.py).

The conversation and task management are handled by MagenticOneOrchestrator (from custom_orchaster.py), which coordinates the interaction logic.
