# Where2Surf

## ðŸŒŠ Overview

This project uses a **forked version** of the [`pysurfline`](https://github.com/Mircobrb/pysurfline) package to access surf data from the Surfline API. It fetches surf forecast data for given spot IDs and structures the output into a clean **Pandas DataFrame**, making it easy to analyze and manipulate.

This work is partially inspired by [Justin Gosses' Surfline API exploration](https://observablehq.com/@justingosses/surfline-api-exploration), which helped uncover how to interact with the API endpoints effectively.
